My name's Marcello and I work on the ProtectAI/Huntr Threat Research team, a few months ago we got a report (from @nicecatch2000) of a ReDoS affecting another very popular Python web framework. After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).  Here are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:  ```Python from typing import Annotated from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse from fastapi import FastAPI,Form from pydantic import BaseModel  class Item(BaseModel):     username: str  app = FastAPI()  @app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse) async def index():     return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)  @app.post(\"/submit/\") async def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):     return {\"username\": username}  @app.post(\"/submit_json/\") async def submit_json(item: Item):     return {\"username\": item.username} ```  I'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:  ```console uvicorn server:app ```  Then run the following cUrl command:  ``` curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/' ```  You'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%  You can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.  If you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.  Cheers  #### Impact  An attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.  #### Occurrences  [params.py L586](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586)  </details>"}, {"id": "GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3", "fix_versions": ["0.0.18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-53981"], "description": "### Summary  When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary.

An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  ### Impact  Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.   ### Original Report  This security issue was reported by: - GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck - Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi"}]}, {"name": "pywin32", "version": "311", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyyaml", "version": "6.0.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rapidfuzz", "version": "3.14.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "referencing", "version": "0.36.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "requests", "version": "2.32.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "requests-oauthlib", "version": "2.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rich", "version": "13.9.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rpds-py", "version": "0.27.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rsa", "version": "4.9.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ruamel-yaml", "version": "0.18.10", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ruamel-yaml-clib", "version": "0.2.12", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ruff", "version": "0.12.11", "vulns": []}, {"name": "s3transfer", "version": "0.13.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "scikit-learn", "version": "1.3.2", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2024-110", "fix_versions": ["1.5.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5206"], "description": "A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which was fixed in version 1.5.0.

Instead of just checking for `self._in_memory` we should also check if the additional bytes will cause a rollover.  ```python      @property     def _in_memory(self) -> bool:         # check for SpooledTemporaryFile._rolled         rolled_to_disk = getattr(self.file, \"_rolled\", True)         return not rolled_to_disk      async def write(self, data: bytes) -> None:         if self.size is not None:             self.size += len(data)          if self._in_memory:             self.file.write(data)         else:             await run_in_threadpool(self.file.write, data) ```  I have already created a PR which fixes the problem: https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2962   ### PoC See the discussion [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/2927#discussioncomment-13721403) for steps on how to reproduce.  ### Impact To be honest, very low and not many users will be impacted. Parsing large forms is already CPU intensive so the additional IO block doesn't slow down `starlette` that much on systems with modern HDDs/SSDs. If someone is running on tape they might see a greater impact."}]}, {"name": "temporalio", "version": "1.16.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tenacity", "version": "9.1.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "thefuzz", "version": "0.22.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "threadpoolctl", "version": "3.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tokenizers", "version": "0.22.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "toml", "version": "0.10.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tqdm", "version": "4.67.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "truststore", "version": "0.10.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typer", "version": "0.17.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "types-protobuf", "version": "6.30.2.20250822", "vulns": []}, {"name": "types-requests", "version": "2.32.4.20250809", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-extensions", "version": "4.12.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-inspection", "version": "0.4.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "uritemplate", "version": "4.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "urllib3", "version": "2.3.0", "vulns": [{"id": "GHSA-48p4-8xcf-vxj5", "fix_versions": ["2.5.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-50182"], "description": "urllib3 [supports](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.0/reference/contrib/emscripten.html) being used in a Pyodide runtime utilizing the [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or falling back on [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest). This means you can use Python libraries to make HTTP requests from your browser or Node.js. Additionally, urllib3 provides [a mechanism](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.0/user-guide.html#retrying-requests) to control redirects.  However, the `retries` and `redirect` parameters are ignored with Pyodide; the runtime itself determines redirect behavior.   ## Affected usages  Any code which relies on urllib3 to control the number of redirects for an HTTP request in a Pyodide runtime.   ## Impact  Redirects are often used to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects may remain vulnerable if a Pyodide runtime redirect mechanism is unsuitable.   ## Remediation  If you use urllib3 in Node.js, upgrade to a patched version of urllib3.  Unfortunately, browsers provide no suitable way which urllib3 can use: `XMLHttpRequest` provides no control over redirects, the Fetch API returns `opaqueredirect` responses lacking data when redirects are controlled manually.

The most common way to disable redirects is at the request level, as follows:  ```python resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\", redirect=False) print(resp.status) # 302 ```  However, it is also possible to disable redirects, for all requests, by instantiating a `PoolManager` and specifying `retries` in a way that disable redirects:  ```python import urllib3  http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=0)  # should raise MaxRetryError on redirect http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=urllib3.Retry(redirect=0))  # equivalent to the above http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=False)  # should return the first response  resp = http.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\") ```  However, the `retries` parameter is currently ignored, which means all the above examples don't disable redirects.  ## Affected usages  Passing `retries` on `PoolManager` instantiation to disable redirects or restrict their number.  By default, requests and botocore users are not affected.  ## Impact  Redirects are often used to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable.  ## Remediation  You can remediate this vulnerability with the following steps:   * Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3. If your organization would benefit from the continued support of urllib3 1.x, please contact [sethmichaellarson@gmail.com](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com) to discuss sponsorship or contribution opportunities.  * Disable redirects at the `request()` level instead of the `PoolManager()` level."}]}, {"name": "uvicorn", "version": "0.24.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "watchfiles", "version": "1.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "wcwidth", "version": "0.2.13", "vulns": []}, {"name": "websockets", "version": "15.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "wheel", "version": "0.45.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "win-inet-pton", "version": "1.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "xmltodict", "version": "0.13.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "yarl", "version": "1.20.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "yt-dlp", "version": "2025.9.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "zipp", "version": "3.23.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "zstandard", "version": "0.23.0", "vulns": []}], "fixes": []}
